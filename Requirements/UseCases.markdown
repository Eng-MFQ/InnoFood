| **Brief description**           | Admin creates a new cafe/canteen, and sets up all parameters for it, he also assigns manager to that canteen. |
| **Preconditions**               | Newly built, or cafe not entered at the system, manager, earlier created by admin. |
| **Flow of events**              | First, administrator enters all the data needed for the cafe, as: Phone number, email, name, address, information about cafe, manager(information about him is automatically displayed when he is chosed). Then he click the create button, and get all data displayed to check, he can approve, or return back to changing, after this step he click approve button, and the response goes to server, cafe wouldn't be seen by users, until manager would "open" it, after he fills all the needed data. |
| **Postconditions**              | New cafe added to the list of administrator, it is seen to the manager, that is responsible for this cafeterium, as well as for users, if this canteen is open. The cafe data is stationed in DB on backend. |
| **Priority**                    | Top priority, because the other way there would be no canteens to serve the users. |
| **Assumptions**                 | If admin would enter data in incorrect format, he would need to reenter it. |
| **Non-behavioral requirements** | Performance to a website response of the whole system is limited to three seconds, in this time DB should be updated and frontend must respond. Only user with the rights of admin could create cafeteriums. |
